Lesson 10

I learned that Search Engine Optimization or SEO works best for websites that are well organized. 
Properly named H tags and alt text will get scanned and garner good organic results. 
Hidden key terms will effect your SEO performance negatively. 

There are many things I can do to enhance the web traffic to my web sites. 
Adding social media meta tags are crucial. 
Incorporating links to other solid websites and encouraging others to reciprocate will help increase traffic. 
Using Google analytics to measure activity will inform any changes that need doing. 
Finally, engaging some online education resources like Moz will only help my SEO understanding 
and keep me up to date on the prevailing trends in the field of front end web development.
